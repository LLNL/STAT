.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The Stack Trace Analysis Tool is a highly scalable, lightweight tool that gathers and merges stack traces from all of the processes of a parallel application. STATBench is a benchmark that can emulate STAT's performance. By utilizing your entire parallel allocation (launching one STATBench daemon emulator per core) and generating artificial stack traces, STATBench is able model STAT's performance using less resources than an actual STAT run requires. With various options, you can also map STATBench to your target machine architecture and target application. After completion, STATBench will create a STAT_results directory in your current working directory. This directory will contain a subdirectory for the current run, with the merged stack traces in DOT format as well as a performance results text file. 
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
\fB-a, --autotopo\fR
let STAT automatically create topology.
.TP
\fB-f, --fanout \fIwidth\fB\fR
Sets the maximum tree topology fanout to \fIwidth\fR\&. Specify nodes to launch communications processes on with \fB--nodes\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-d, --depth \fIdepth\fB\fR
Sets the tree topology depth to \fIdepth\fR\&. This option takes precedence over the \fB--fanout\fR option. Specify nodes to launch communications processes on with \fB--nodes\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-u, --usertopology \fItopology\fB\fR
Specify the number of communication nodes per layer in the tree topology, separated by dashes, with \fItopology\fR\&. This option takes precedence over the \fB--fanout\fR and \fB--depth\fR options. Specify nodes to launch communications processes on with \fB--nodes\fR\&. Example topologies: 4, 4-16, 5-20-75.
.TP
\fB-n, --nodes \fInodelist\fB\fR
Use the specified nodes in \fInodelist\fR\&. To be used with \fB--fanout\fR, \fB--depth\fR, or \fB--usertopology\fR options. Example nodes lists: host1; host1,host2; host[1,5-7,9].
.TP
\fB-A, --appnodes\fR
Allow tool communication processes to be co-located on nodes running application processes.
.TP
\fB-p, --procs \fIprocesses\fB\fR
Sets the maximum number of communication processes to be spawned per node to \fIprocesses\fR\&. This should typically be set to the number of CPUs per node.
.TP
\fB-D, --daemon \fIpath\fB\fR
Specify the full path \fIpath\fR to the STATBench daemon executable. Use this only if you wish to override the default.
.TP
\fB-F, --filter \fIpath\fB\fR
Specify the full path \fIpath\fR to the STATBench filter shared object. Use this only if you wish to override the default.
.TP
\fB-t, --traces \fIcount\fB\fR
Gather \fIcount\fR traces per process.
.TP
\fB-i, --iters \fIcount\fB\fR
Perform \fIcount\fR gathers.
.TP
\fB-n, --numtasks \fIcount\fB\fR
Emulate \fIcount\fR tasks per daemon.
.TP
\fB-m, --maxdepth \fIdepth\fB\fR
Generate traces with a maximum depth of \fIdepth\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-b, --branch \fIwidth\fB\fR
Generate traces with a max branching factor of \fIwidth\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-e, --eqclasses \fIcount\fB\fR
Generate traces within \fIcount\fR equivalence classes.
.TP
\fB-l, --log\fR
Enable debug logging of the \fIFE\fR, \fIBE\fR, or \fIALL\fR\&.
.TP
\fB-L, --logdir \fIlog_directory\fB\fR
Dump logging output into \fIlog_directory\fR\&. To be used with the \fB--log\fR option.
.TP
\fB-M, --mrnetprintf\fR
Use MRNet's printf for STAT debug logging.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.PP
In the simplest form, you can invoke STATBench, from within a parallel allocation, with no arguments. This will run through with the default settings:
.PP
.sp
.nf
  % STATBench
    
.sp
.fi
.PP
To model your target machine architecture, you can specify the number of tasks to emulate per daemon. For instance if your target machine has 16-way SMP compute nodes:
.PP
.sp
.nf
  % STATBench --numtasks 16
    
.sp
.fi
.PP
You may also want to model a specific application. For instance, you may have a climate modeling code with 5 distinct task behaviors, or equivalence classes. You can also specify the maximum call depth of your application, the average branching factor from a given function, and the number of distinct traces expected per task:
.PP
.sp
.nf
  % STATBench --eqclasses 5 --maxdepth 17 --branch 5 --traces 4
    
.sp
.fi
.PP
At larger scales, you may want to employ a more scalable tree topology. For example, if you're running 1024 daemon emulators, you may want to try a fanout of sqrt(1024) = 32. You will need to specify a list of nodes that contains enough processors to accommodate the ceil(1024/32) = 32 communication processes being launched. Be sure that you have login permissions to the specified nodes and that they contain the mrnet_commnode executable and the STAT_FilterDefinitions.so library:
.PP
.sp
.nf
  % STATBench --fanout 32 --nodes atlas[1-4] --procs 8
    
.sp
.fi
