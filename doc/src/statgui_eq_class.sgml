stat-gui can also serve as an interface to attach a full-featured debugger such as TotalView or DDT to a subset of application tasks.  This interface can be accessed through the "identify equivalence classes" <GUIbutton>Eq C</GUIbutton> button, which will pop up the equivalence classes window <![%userguide[(<xref linkend="statgui_eq_classes">)]]>.  You can then select a single representative, all, or none of an equivalence classes' tasks to form a subset of tasks. The <GUIbutton>Attach to Subset</GUIbutton> buttons will launch the specified debugger and attach to the subset of tasks (note, this detaches STAT from the application). The <GUIbutton>Debugger Options</GUIbutton> button allows you to modify the debugger path.
