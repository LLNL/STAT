<para>
The most typical usage is to invoke STAT on the job launcher's PID:
</para>
<informalexample>
    <screen>
  % srun mpi_application arg1 arg2 &
  [1] 16482
  
  % ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
  16755 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
  16842 pts/0    00:00:00 srun
  16871 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
  
  % stat-cl 16482
    </screen>
</informalexample>
<para>
You can also launch your application under STAT's control with the <option>-C</option> option.  All arguments after <option>-C</option> are used for job launch:
</para>
<informalexample>
    <screen>
  % stat-cl -C srun mpi_application arg1 arg2
    </screen>
</informalexample>
<para>
With the <option>-a</option> option (or when automatic topology is set as default), STAT will try to automatically create a scalable topology for large scale jobs.  However, if you wish you may manually specify a topology at larger scales.  For example, if you're running on 1024 nodes, you may want to try a fanout of sqrt(1024) = 32.  You will need to specify a list of nodes that contains enough processors to accommodate the ceil(1024/32) = 32 communication processes being launched with the <option>--nodes</option> option.  Be sure that you have login permissions to the specified nodes and that they contain the mrnet_commnode executable and the STAT_FilterDefinitions.so library.
</para>
<informalexample>
    <screen>
  % stat-cl --fanout 32 --nodes atlas[1-4] --procs 8 16482
    </screen>
</informalexample>
<para>
Upon successful completion, STAT will write its output to a stat_results directory within the current working directory.  Each run creates a subdirectory named after the application with a unique integer ID.  STAT's output indicates the directory created with a message such as:
</para>
<informalexample>
    <screen>
  Results written to /home/user/bin/stat_results/mpi_application.6
    </screen>
</informalexample>
<para>
Within that directory will be one or more files with a .dot extension.  These .dot files can be viewed with <command>stat-view</command>.
</para>
