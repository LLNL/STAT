The Stack Trace Analysis Tool (STAT) is a highly scalable, lightweight debugger for parallel applications.  STAT is developed as a collaboration between the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the University of Wisconsin, the University of New Mexico, and the Denmark Technical University.  It is currently open source software released under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license.  It builds on a highly-portable, open-source infrastructure, including LaunchMON for tool daemon launching, MRNet for scalable communication, and StackWalker for obtaining stack traces.

STAT works by gathering stack traces from all of a parallel application's processes and merging them into a compact and intuitive form.  The resulting output indicates the location in the code that each application process is executing, which can help narrow down a bug.  Furthermore, the merging process naturally groups processes that exhibit similar behavior into process equivalence classes.  A single representative of each equivalence can then be examined with a full-featured debugger like <ulink url="http://www.roguewave.com/products-services/totalview">TotalView</ulink> or <ulink url="http://www.allinea.com">DDT</ulink> for more in-depth analysis.

STAT has been ported to several platforms, including x86, Power, and Arm Linux clusters, IBM's Bluegene/L, Bluegene/P, and Bluegene/Q machines, and Cray systems.  It works for Message Passing Interface (MPI) applications written in C, C++, and Fortran and also supports threads. STAT can also use cuda-gdb for its backend, enabling it to gather GPU stack traces in CUDA codes.  STAT has already demonstrated scalability over 3,000,000 MPI tasks and its logarithmic scaling characteristics position it well for even larger systems.
