The Stack Trace Analysis Tool (STAT) is a highly scalable, lightweight debugger for parallel applications.  STAT was initially developed as a collaboration between the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the University of Wisconsin.  It is currently open source software released under the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license.  It builds on a highly portable, open source infrastructure, including LaunchMON for tool daemon launching, MRNet for scalable communication, and StackWalker for obtaining stack traces.

STAT works by gathering stack traces from all of a parallel application's processes and merging them into a compact and intuitive form.  The resulting output indicates the location in the code that each application process is executing, which can help narrow down a bug.  Furthermore, the merging process naturally groups processes that exhibit similar behavior into process equivalence classes.  A single representative of each equivalence can then be examined with a full-featured debugger like <ulink url="http://www.totalviewtech.com/">TotalView</ulink> or <ulink url="http://www.allinea.com/index.php?page=48">DDT</ulink> for more in-depth analysis.

STAT has been ported to several platforms, including Linux clusters, IBM's Bluegene/L and Bluegene/P machines, and Cray XT systems.  It works for Message Passing Interface (MPI) applications written in C, C++, and Fortran and also supports threads.  STAT has already demonstrated scalability over 200,000 MPI tasks and its logarithmic scaling characteristics position it well for even larger systems.
